    {"category": "Advanced", "question": "Difference between multi-threading and multi-processing?", "answer": "Multi-threading runs multiple threads within a single process (sharing memory, limited by GIL), suitable for I/O bound tasks. Multi-processing runs multiple processes (separate memory space, bypasses GIL), suitable for CPU bound tasks."},
    {"category": "Advanced", "question": "What is Cython?", "answer": "Cython is a superset of the Python language that additionally supports calling C functions and declaring C types on variables and class attributes. It allows compiling Python code into C extensions for performance."},
    {"category": "Advanced", "question": "How does garbage collection work in Python?", "answer": "Python uses reference counting mainly. When an object's reference count drops to zero, it is deallocated. It also has a cycle detector to handle circular references."},
    {"category": "Advanced", "question": "What are slots?", "answer": "`__slots__` is a magic attribute that restricts the attributes an object can have, saving memory by avoiding the creation of `__dict__` for each instance."},

    {"category": "Advanced", "question": "What is single dispatch?", "answer": "`functools.singledispatch` transforms a function into a generic function, which can have different behaviors depending on the type of its first argument."},
    {"category": "Advanced", "question": "How to optimize Python code?", "answer": "Using efficient data structures, built-in functions, list comprehensions, profiling tools (cProfile), using caching (lru_cache), using PyPy, or rewriting critical parts in C/Cython."},
    {"category": "Advanced", "question": "What is the weakref module?", "answer": "The `weakref` module allows the programmer to create weak references to objects. A weak reference does not keep the object alive if there are no other strong references to it."},
    {"category": "Advanced", "question": "What is string interning?", "answer": "String interning is a method of storing only one copy of each distinct string value, which must be immutable. Python automatically interns some strings (like small identifiers) to save memory and compare them faster."},
    {"category": "Advanced", "question": "Explain the `yield` keyword.", "answer": "`yield` suspends a function’s execution and sends a value back to the caller, but retains enough state to enable the function to resume where it is left off. It turns a function into a generator."},
    {"category": "Advanced", "question": "What are coroutines?", "answer": "Coroutines are generalizations of subroutines. They are used for cooperative multitasking where a process voluntarily yields control periodically or when idle in order to enable multiple applications to be run simultaneously."},
    {"category": "Advanced", "question": "What is the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`?", "answer": "`@classmethod` takes the class as the first argument, allowing access to class state. `@staticmethod` takes no implicit first argument and behaves like a plain function, just namespaced within the class."},
    {"category": "Advanced", "question": "What is the `collections` module?", "answer": "A module implementing specialized container datatypes providing alternatives to Python's general purpose built-in containers, dict, list, set, and tuple. Examples: namedtuple, deque, Counter, OrderedDict, defaultdict."},
    {"category": "Advanced", "question": "What is `__call__` method?", "answer": "It allows an instance of a class to be called as a function."},
    {"category": "Advanced", "question": "What is method overloading vs overriding?", "answer": "Python does not support method overloading (having multiple methods with same name but different arguments) natively like C++/Java, but supports overriding (redefining a parent's method in a child class)."},
    {"category": "Advanced", "question": "Explain name mangling in Python.", "answer": "Name mangling is a mechanism where any identifier with two leading underscores and no more than one trailing underscore is textually replaced with `_ClassName__identifier` to avoid name clashes in subclasses."},
